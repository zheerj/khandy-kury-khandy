# Generic Discord Bot
This is a generic [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot, a starting point for any developer that plans to use [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org) as part of their architecture.

-------------------------

## The Step-By-Step Guide

### Environment Setup
- Clone the project

  > `git clone git@github.com:nickjpanella/discordbot.git`

- Create the .env (dotenv) file :: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
  - This allows us to store our private keys in a location thats safe and easy to access. It can also serve as a properties file for other variables that we want to use accross the application. 
  
  - For this project, we use three in particular.
  
    KEY | Description
    ----|------
    TOKEN | This is the value of your Discord bot token.
    PREFIX | The symbol you want to use for bot commands. (Default if not provide is a `/` )
    ALLOWED_GUILDS | This is a `\|` (bar) delimited list that is optional but can be used if you want to restrict the bot to specific Discord Servers.

- Package Manager ( I suggest [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) )

  > `npm install -g yarn`

- Install the Node Modules ( There is a `postinstall` script that will build the project from Typescript into JavaScript )

  > `yarn install` | `npm install`

### File Management 
When working with this project, keep in mind the file management

``` text
| -- dist/
|     this is generated when you build the project, includes the 
|     JavaScript files. 
| -- src/
      | -- bot-message.ts 
      |     `BotMessage class` sets up a message you want to relay
      | -- discord-bot.ts 
      |     `DiscordBot class` initializes all of your commands
      |     and listeners
      | -- express-app.ts
      |     `expressApp module` creates and exports it to be used
      |     in the main 'src/bin/index.ts' file
      | -- bin/
            | -- index.ts
            |     This is your main "runnable" file, includes the
            |     setup for `DiscordBot` and `expressApp`
      | -- commands/
            | -- command.abstract.ts
            |     `BotCommand class` The abstract command class
            | -- *.command.ts
            |     `ExampleCommand class` This extends BotCommand 
            |     and includes your definitions of each command
            | -- index.ts
            |     Exports all of the classes bound together, this 
            |     isn't mandatory, but keeps things organized.
      | -- domains/
            | -- *.domain.ts
            |     These are your domain models (interfaces)
      | -- listeners/
            | -- *.listener.ts
            |     Here are you listeners, necessary components for 
            |     your bot to observe what's going on on your server.
      | -- routes/
            | -- public.ts
            |     These are your public APIs for Express to serve.
      | -- utils/
            | -- *.util.ts
            |     Creating utils allows you to keep your code clean
            |     and help reduce redundant code.
```

### Development
When developing using this project I implemented a "watch" script that will keep an eye on your local changes and will rebuild the application with every change (generating the dist/*.js) 

> `yarn watch` | `npm run watch`

Set up your `src/bin/index.ts` file to configure your bot.
```JavaScript
  const botConfig: IBotConfig = {
    discordToken: token,
    allowedGuilds: guilds,
    botListeners: [
      "ready", "guildCreate", "guildDelete", "message"
    ],
    botCommands: [
      "help", "ping", "echo"
    ],
    botActivity: "The Game",
    botUsername: "Discord Bot",
    cmdPrefix: prefix ? prefix : "/"
  };

  new Bot().start(
    botConfig,
    `${__dirname}/../commands`,
    `${__dirname}/../listeners`,
    `${__dirname}/../data`
  );
```


### Deployment
I chose [Heroku](https://heroku.com) because its only $7.00 /month to run a container indefinitely. 
- Download the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).
- > heroku login (with your email and password)
- > heroku create `discord-bot` -b `heroku/nodejs`
- > heroku config:set --app=`discord-bot` TOKEN=%replacewithyourtoken%
- > heroku config:set --app=`discord-bot` PREFIX=%replacewithyourprefix%
- > heroku config:set --app=`discord-bot` ALLOWED_GUILDS=%replacewithyourguilds%
- > heorku git:remote --app=`discord-bot`
- > git push heroku HEAD:master
